Good direction. You want it to feel written by a human who actually built and used the system, not a spec sheet and not an essay.

NetBenefits Page Prioritization Engine

Design, Usage, and Rationale


---

Overview

The NetBenefits Page Prioritization Engine is an interactive Streamlit application built to help teams decide where to focus improvement efforts across application pages. The idea is simple: combine multiple performance signals into a single, comparable priority score, while still allowing teams to adjust assumptions and see how outcomes change.

Rather than hard-coding one definition of “priority,” the tool allows users to express different viewpoints through weighting profiles and then compare the results side by side.


---

What Problem This Solves

Page performance is rarely explained by a single metric. High traffic does not always mean high impact, and low satisfaction does not always mean urgency unless volume or friction supports it.

This tool helps answer questions such as:

Which pages create the most customer effort at scale?

How do priorities shift if friction is weighted more than engagement?

Which pages are consistently important regardless of assumptions?


By making trade-offs explicit, the application supports clearer, faster decision-making.


---

Data Input and Scope

The application reads from a single Excel file (data.xlsx) located in the same directory as the code.

Key characteristics:

Data is treated as read-only

Column names are fixed and case-sensitive

All filtering and transformation happens in memory


Filters are applied using the sidebar and affect all calculations consistently:

Category and sub-category

Transaction flag

Minimum response threshold (where applicable)


This keeps the analysis flexible without altering the underlying data.


---

How Priority Is Calculated (In Plain Terms)

Each page group receives a priority score based on multiple metrics. Because these metrics operate on very different scales, they are first normalized.

Important points:

All metrics are normalized using min–max scaling

Satisfaction scores are inverted so that lower satisfaction increases priority

User-defined weights are normalized internally so relative importance matters more than raw slider values


The final score is a weighted sum of these normalized values. Pages are then ranked from highest to lowest priority.

The goal is not mathematical complexity, but clarity and consistency.


---

Weighting Profiles and Scenario Analysis

The application supports multiple weighting profiles, each representing a different strategic lens.

Examples include:

A balanced view where all factors matter equally

A friction-focused view that emphasizes calls and effort

An engagement-heavy view that prioritizes volume and usage


Profiles:

Can be added or removed dynamically

Are named by the user

Are displayed as tabs for easy comparison


This makes it easy to test “what-if” scenarios without losing track of earlier assumptions.


---

Profile Comparison

When multiple profiles exist, the system compares the priority scores between profiles. Rather than just showing two ranked lists, it highlights where and how much priorities differ.

This comparison is useful for:

Identifying pages sensitive to strategic assumptions

Understanding disagreements between teams

Focusing discussion on high-impact differences rather than noise


The comparison logic is intentionally kept simple and modular so it can evolve without affecting the rest of the application.


---

Visual Exploration

Beyond ranking, the application includes an exploration section for deeper analysis.

This includes:

Bar charts showing top or bottom pages for a selected metric

Scatter plots with linear regression to inspect relationships between metrics


These visuals are not meant to replace the priority score, but to:

Validate assumptions

Reveal unexpected patterns

Support deeper investigation when needed



---

Design Choices and Rationale (Selected)

Some design decisions are worth calling out explicitly.

Why normalization instead of z-scores?

Min–max normalization preserves relative ordering

It is easier to explain to non-technical users

It avoids unintuitive negative values


Why invert satisfaction metrics?

Low satisfaction represents higher urgency

Inversion ensures all inputs move priority in the same direction


Why allow multiple profiles instead of one “correct” model?

Different teams value different outcomes

The goal is alignment through comparison, not enforcement


Why keep comparison logic simple?

Most value comes from seeing deltas, not complex statistics

Simpler logic is easier to trust and extend

FAQ

Q: Why not use a machine learning model for prioritization?
A: The goal is transparency and control. A weighted model makes assumptions explicit and easy to challenge. For prioritization discussions, interpretability matters more than predictive power.

Q: Why normalize weights as well as metrics?
A: Without weight normalization, absolute slider values can distort results. Normalization ensures that intent (relative importance) drives outcomes.

Q: Why is comparison limited to two profiles?
A: Most discussions involve comparing two viewpoints. The design keeps the current behavior simple while allowing future expansion to multi-profile comparisons.

Q: Why is data exploration separate from prioritization?
A: Mixing exploration with ranking can distract from decisions. Separating them keeps prioritization focused while still supporting deeper analysis when needed.

Q: Why is the application read-only?
A: This avoids accidental data corruption and keeps the tool safe for shared use.

Extensibility and Future Use

The current structure supports:

Adding new metrics

Introducing alternative comparison logic

Exporting results

Enhancing visualization


These can be implemented without changing the core workflow or existing assumptions.

Closing Thoughts

This tool is meant to support structured thinking, not replace judgment. Its value comes from making assumptions visible, enabling comparison, and grounding discussions in data.

Used correctly, it helps teams move from opinion-driven debates to evidence-based prioritization.
